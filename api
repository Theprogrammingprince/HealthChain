there was a boy named john
and he was the laziest boy in the entire town
one day john saw an apple tree which was shining red apple
he wanted to eat some but was too lazy to climb the tree
instead he laid on the grass for the apples to fall on their own
but of course the apples didnt fall and soon john was very very hungry
because he hardly works for his food
