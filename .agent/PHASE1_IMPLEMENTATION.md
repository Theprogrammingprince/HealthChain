# Phase 1 - Database Integration Completed

## Item 1: Patient Dashboard Integration ✅

### Database Service Functions (`lib/database.service.ts`)
Added new functions for patient medical records:

- **`getPatientApprovedRecords(patientId)`** - Fetches all approved records for a patient with doctor/hospital names enriched
- **`getPatientPendingApprovals(patientId)`** - Fetches records waiting for patient approval
- **`approveRecordAsPatient(recordId, patientId)`** - Updates record status when patient approves
- **`rejectRecordAsPatient(recordId, patientId, reason?)`** - Updates record status when patient rejects with optional reason
- **`getAllPatientRecords(patientId)`** - Fetches all patient records regardless of status

### Store Updates (`lib/store.ts`)
- Changed `fetchUserProfile()` to fetch from `medical_record_submissions` table instead of old `medical_records` table
- Added enrichment logic to fetch doctor and hospital names for each record
- Added `mapRecordTypeToCategory()` helper function to map record types to dashboard tabs

### PendingRecordsList Component (`components/dashboard/PendingRecordsList.tsx`)
Completely rewritten to:
- Fetch real pending approval records from database
- Show loading state while fetching
- Display actual doctor/hospital names from database
- Implement working Approve/Reject buttons with database updates
- Include rejection reason dialog for proper UX
- Remove all mock data

---

## Item 2: Hospital Approval Workflow ✅

### Database Service Functions (`lib/database.service.ts`)
Added hospital record approval operations:

- **`getHospitalPendingReviews(hospitalId)`** - Fetches records pending hospital review with doctor/patient names
- **`approveRecordAsHospital(recordId, hospitalId, reviewerId)`** - Approves record, moves to `pending_patient_approval`
- **`rejectRecordAsHospital(recordId, hospitalId, reviewerId, reason?)`** - Rejects with required reason
- **`getAllHospitalSubmissions(hospitalId)`** - Fetches all submissions with any status for history

### DoctorSubmissionTable Component (`components/dashboard/DoctorSubmissionTable.tsx`)
Completely rewritten to:
- Fetch real submissions from `medical_record_submissions` table
- Load hospital ID from session for current user
- Display enriched doctor and patient names
- Implement working Approve/Reject with database updates
- Add search and filter functionality (by status)
- Include rejection reason dialog (required for rejection)
- Show pending count badge
- Display correct status badges for all workflow states
- Remove all mock data

## Complete Data Flow

```
Doctor submits record (DoctorRecordUploadForm)
       ↓
medical_record_submissions (status: pending_hospital_review)
       ↓
Hospital Admin sees in DoctorSubmissionTable → Approve/Reject
       ↓
If approved: (status: pending_patient_approval)
If rejected: (status: rejected, hospital_rejection_reason stored)
       ↓
Patient sees in PendingRecordsList → Approve/Reject
       ↓
If approved: (status: approved) → appears in Patient Dashboard
If rejected: (status: rejected, patient_rejection_reason stored)
```
